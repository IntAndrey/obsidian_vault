When you think about FOSS documentation utilities, note-takers like [TriliumNext Notes](https://www.xda-developers.com/triliumnext-notes-guide/) or [BookStack](https://www.xda-developers.com/bookstack-guide/) might be the first options that come to mind. However, NetBox is a lot different from its rivals. Rather than letting you fill up documents or spreadsheets with your home server details, NetBox is a cross between an IP address management (IPAM) tool and a datacenter infrastructure management (DCIM) utility that also lets you create records of practically every aspect of your home lab.
